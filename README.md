Project -1
Unlocking Insights from the IMDb Top 1000 Movies Data 

Introduction
The IMDb Top 1000 Movies dataset offers a fascinating look into the world of cinema. In this project, I performed data analysis and visualization to uncover trends among the highest-rated films. This article walks through my approach, findings, and insights.
Project Overview
Objective: To analyze IMDb's Top 1000 movies and extract meaningful trends regarding directors, genres, and financial performance.
Dataset: The dataset includes movie ratings, genres, runtime, box office earnings, and other attributes.
Data Cleaning
To ensure accurate analysis, I performed the following data preprocessing steps:
Converted runtime (e.g., "142 min") into numerical values.
Transformed gross earnings (e.g., "$28,341,469") into float values.
Replaced missing gross values with 0.
Handled missing certificates by assigning "NR" (Not Reported).
Dropped rows with missing Meta Scores for critical analysis.
